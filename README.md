## Data Source Flexibility

This indicator provides flexibility in choosing the data source to be used for analysis. The available options are TICKS and PRICE. By default, TICKS is selected as the data source.

## Adaptive Grid Spacing

The grid spacing is dynamically adjusted based on the selected timeframe. Different timeframes require different grid spacing values to ensure accurate analysis. The grid spacing values for each timeframe are as follows:
- M1: 0.001
- M5: 0.005
- M15: 0.01
- H1: 0.02
- H4: 0.05
- D1: 0.1

## Adaptive High Volume Search Step

The search step for identifying high volume areas is calculated based on the box size. The search step is set to half of the box size value to efficiently scan for high volume areas.

## Automatic Chameleon Color

The color of the indicator dynamically changes based on certain criteria. By default, the indicator color is set to red. However, if specific conditions are met, the color changes to green or blue. This feature allows for easy identification of different market conditions.

## Expert initialization function

The `OnInit()` function is the initialization function of the indicator. It sets the appropriate data source based on the selected option. It also calculates and adjusts the grid spacing, determines the search step for high volume areas, and changes the color of the indicator. After the initialization process, the indicator continues with the rest of its functionality.
